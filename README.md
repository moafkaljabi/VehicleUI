## Features
- **Dashboard**: Displays vehicle metrics like speed, fuel level, temperature, etc.
- **Controls**: Allows users to interact with vehicle systems, such as starting/stopping the engine, adjusting climate control, and more.
- **Real-time Updates**: Leverages WebSockets (or similar) for live updates, ensuring the UI reflects current vehicle data instantly.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed with Qt to run on multiple platforms seamlessly.

## Technologies Used
- **Qt / Qt Creator**: For designing and implementing the UI.
- **C++**: Core programming language for application logic and backend integration.
- **Networking**: Uses HTTP/HTTPS for initial connection, and WebSockets for live data streaming.
- **MySQL**: (If applicable) Stores user preferences and historical vehicle data.
- **MQTT**: Communication protocol for interaction with IoT devices.
